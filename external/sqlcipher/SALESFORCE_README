Binaries in this folder were obtained from: https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/open-source/

However sqlcipher was recompiled with FTS support by doing (see https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-for-android/ for more details):
- get android ndk
- check out git://github.com/sqlcipher/android-database-sqlcipher.git
- run: make init
- edit external/sqlcipher/Makefile, add -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3 -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_PARENTHESIS to CFLAGS
- copy generated .so files from external/libs over the corresponding .so files downloaded from https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/open-source/
